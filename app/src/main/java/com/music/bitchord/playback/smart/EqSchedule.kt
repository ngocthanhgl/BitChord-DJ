/**
 * The per-transition-type 3-band EQ schedules from the DJ-EQ spec, as pure
 * functions of blend progress. No audio, no threads, no ExoPlayer — the
 * numbers below are the spec's schedule tables with linear interpolation
 * between rows, so a unit test can pin every row without rendering a sample.
 *
 * Conventions (spec §EQ schedules):
 * - progress 0.0 = start of overlap, 1.0 = end. Gain 1.0 = unity, 0.0 = kill.
 * - Each deck's gains are keyframes; [at] interpolates linearly between them.
 * - LOW on a swap type (SMOOTH, HARMONIC, FILTER_SWEEP, HALF_TIME_BLEND) is a
 *   placeholder: the controller's bass-swap state machine owns the LOW band
 *   there ([BASS_SWAP_PROGRESS], fired on a downbeat), because only it knows
 *   when the swap actually fired. Table-driven types (ECHO, LOOP, DISSOLVE)
 *   carry their real LOW keyframes below.
 * - `duckAMids` / `delayBMids` are the spec's ARM-time vocal flags. When false
 *   the `V?` / `V?B` rows are skipped and mids stay at unity until the close.
